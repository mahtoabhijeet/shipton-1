# Sentence-based P/NP Oscillating Transformer Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation

### 1. Dataset Design
- **Vocabulary**: Create a controlled vocabulary of ~100-200 common words
- **Sentence Patterns**: Design simple but meaningful sentence structures
- **Data Generation**: Implement a generator for consistent sentence patterns

### 2. Tokenization Strategy
- **Word-level tokenization**: Split sentences into words
- **Special tokens**: [PAD], [START], [END], [UNK]
- **Vocabulary management**: Build and maintain word-to-index mappings

### 3. Model Architecture
- **Base model**: Transformer encoder with positional encoding
- **Input handling**: Process variable-length sentences with padding
- **Output layer**: Predict next word in sequence

## Phase 2: Implementation

### 1. Data Pipeline
- [x] Create sentence dataset generator
- [x] Implement tokenizer with encode/decode functions
- [x] Handle padding and sequence normalization

### 2. Model Development
- [x] Design transformer architecture for sentences
- [x] Implement positional encoding for variable lengths
- [x] Add compression event detection mechanism

### 3. Training Framework
- [x] Implement training loop with batching
- [x] Add P/NP phase oscillation
- [x] Monitor and record compression events

## Phase 3: Enhancement

### 1. Improved Target Generation
- [ ] Create proper next-word prediction targets
- [ ] Implement sequence-to-sequence training
- [ ] Add masking for more sophisticated training

### 2. Evaluation Metrics
- [ ] Implement accuracy metrics for sentence completion
- [ ] Add perplexity calculation
- [ ] Create sample generation functionality

### 3. Model Scaling
- [ ] Experiment with different model sizes
- [ ] Test with larger vocabularies
- [ ] Implement subword tokenization for out-of-vocabulary handling

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 1. Compression Analysis
- [ ] Enhance compression event detection
- [ ] Add visualization of compression patterns
- [ ] Correlate compression events with learning progress

### 2. P/NP Control
- [ ] Implement adaptive phase oscillation
- [ ] Add noise injection for NP-mode
- [ ] Develop phase-based learning rate adjustment

### 3. Real-world Dataset Integration
- [ ] Connect to text datasets (books, articles)
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing pipelines
- [ ] Add dataset filtering and cleaning

## Current Status

The foundation is working:
- ✅ Sentence dataset generation with tokenizer
- ✅ Transformer model with compression detection
- ✅ Training pipeline with P/NP oscillation
- ✅ Compression events are being detected

Next steps needed:
- [ ] Fix target generation for meaningful predictions
- [ ] Improve evaluation metrics
- [ ] Add more sophisticated sentence patterns
- [ ] Enhance model for better sentence understanding

## Technical Considerations

### Model Complexity vs. Dataset Size
- Start with smaller models (1-2 layers, 64-128 dims) for faster iteration
- Scale model complexity with dataset size
- Monitor training stability and convergence

### Memory Management
- Use batching for larger datasets
- Implement gradient clipping for stability
- Consider mixed precision training for larger models

### Evaluation Strategy
- Use both quantitative metrics (loss, accuracy) and qualitative assessment
- Test on held-out data to prevent overfitting
- Monitor compression events as a novel learning signal

This plan provides a clear roadmap for developing a sentence-based P/NP Oscillating Transformer that maintains the core insight detection capabilities while handling the complexity of natural language.
