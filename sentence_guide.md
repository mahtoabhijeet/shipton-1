# Working with Sentences in the P/NP Oscillating Transformer

## Overview

This guide explains how to adapt the P/NP Oscillating Transformer for sentence processing, building on the successful minimal implementation.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Tokenization for Sentences
Unlike character-level processing, sentence processing requires:
- **Word-level tokenization**: Breaking text into meaningful units
- **Vocabulary management**: Handling a larger set of tokens
- **Special tokens**: Padding, start/end markers, unknown word handling

### 2. Sequence Processing
- **Variable lengths**: Sentences have different numbers of words
- **Padding strategies**: Uniform tensor dimensions for batch processing
- **Positional encoding**: Accounting for word positions in sequences

### 3. Training Objectives
- **Next-word prediction**: Predicting the subsequent word in a sequence
- **Sequence modeling**: Learning grammatical and semantic patterns

## Implementation Approach

### Simple Working Example
The simple implementation demonstrates core concepts:

```python
# Vocabulary with special tokens
vocab = ['[PAD]', '[START]', '[END]', 'the', 'cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'runs', 'jumps', 'flies', 'in', 'park', 'home']

# Sentence to token conversion
sentence = "the cat runs in the park"
tokens = [word_to_idx['[START]']] + [word_to_idx[word] for word in sentence.split()] + [word_to_idx['[END]']]
# Result: [1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 3, 11, 2] (START, the, cat, runs, in, the, park, END)

# Create training pairs
# For each position, input is sequence up to that point, target is next word
```

### Model Architecture Adaptations
1. **Larger embedding layer**: To accommodate vocabulary size
2. **Extended positional encoding**: For longer sequences
3. **Modified output layer**: Predicting among vocabulary words

## Scaling to Larger Datasets

### Vocabulary Expansion
- Start with controlled vocabulary (100-500 words)
- Use frequency-based selection for real text
- Implement subword tokenization for large vocabularies

### Data Pipeline
```python
# For larger datasets:
# 1. Text preprocessing
# 2. Vocabulary building
# 3. Sequence generation
# 4. Batching with padding

def create_sequences(text_data, tokenizer, max_length):
    """Convert text to training sequences."""
    sequences = []
    targets = []
    
    for sentence in text_data:
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(sentence)
        # Create input-target pairs for each position
        for i in range(1, len(tokens)):
            input_seq = tokens[:i]
            target = tokens[i]
            sequences.append(pad_sequence(input_seq, max_length))
            targets.append(target)
    
    return sequences, targets
```

### Model Considerations
- Increase model dimensions (d_model=64-128)
- Add more transformer layers (2-4 layers)
- Adjust attention heads (4-8 heads)

## Training Strategies

### 1. Curriculum Learning
Start with:
- Simple sentence patterns
- Small vocabulary
- Short sequences

Progress to:
- Complex grammatical structures
- Larger vocabulary
- Longer sequences

### 2. P/NP Phase Tuning
- Adjust oscillation period for sentence learning
- Modify compression detection thresholds
- Experiment with phase-based learning rates

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- **Perplexity**: Measure of prediction confidence
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct next-word predictions
- **Compression events**: Count and timing of learning moments

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Quality
- Ensure consistent sentence structures
- Remove noisy or inconsistent examples
- Balance pattern distributions

### 2. Model Stability
- Use gradient clipping for longer sequences
- Apply weight decay for regularization
- Monitor for overfitting

### 3. Computational Efficiency
- Use batching for larger datasets
- Implement early stopping
- Monitor memory usage

## Example Results

Our simple implementation showed:
- Successful training with decreasing loss
- Meaningful next-word predictions ("the cat runs" â†’ "in")
- Ability to generalize to unseen sentence patterns

## Next Steps for Development

### 1. Enhanced Tokenization
- Implement Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
- Handle out-of-vocabulary words
- Add special tokens for punctuation

### 2. Advanced Training
- Sequence-to-sequence modeling
- Masked language modeling
- Multi-task learning objectives

### 3. Evaluation Framework
- Automated metrics calculation
- Human evaluation of outputs
- Compression event analysis

### 4. Real-world Integration
- Connect to text datasets
- Implement data streaming
- Add preprocessing pipelines

## Conclusion

Sentence processing in the P/NP Oscillating Transformer requires adapting the core concepts to handle:
- Word-level rather than character-level tokens
- Variable-length sequences with padding
- Larger vocabularies and more complex patterns

The working implementation demonstrates that these adaptations are feasible while maintaining the core insight detection capabilities. The key is to start simple and gradually increase complexity while monitoring both performance metrics and compression events.
