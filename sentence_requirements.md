# Sentence-Based P/NP Oscillating Transformer: Requirements Analysis

## Current Implementation Limitations

1. **Character-Level Processing**: Current model works with individual characters
2. **Fixed Sequence Length**: Limited to short sequences (3-5 tokens)
3. **Simple Vocabulary**: Basic character set with circular pattern logic
4. **Deterministic Patterns**: Predictable next-character rules

## Sentence Processing Requirements

### 1. Tokenization Strategy
- **Word-level tokenization**: Split sentences into words
- **Subword tokenization**: Handle out-of-vocabulary words
- **Special tokens**: Padding, start/end of sentence markers
- **Vocabulary management**: Dynamic vocabulary building

### 2. Data Representation
- **Variable sequence lengths**: Sentences of different lengths
- **Batching strategy**: Handling sequences of different lengths
- **Memory efficiency**: Managing larger token sequences

### 3. Model Architecture Adjustments
- **Increased sequence length handling**: Support for longer sequences
- **Enhanced positional encoding**: For longer sequences
- **Attention mechanism scaling**: Handling longer contexts
- **Memory management**: Efficient processing of longer sequences

### 4. Dataset Considerations
- **Sentence diversity**: Varied sentence structures and topics
- **Contextual relationships**: Meaningful word relationships
- **Training objectives**: Next word prediction, masked language modeling
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, filtering

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
- **Language modeling accuracy**: Predicting next words correctly
- **Perplexity**: Measuring model confidence
- **Semantic coherence**: Evaluating sentence quality
- **Compression event detection**: Validating core concept with sentences

## Challenges to Address

1. **Vocabulary Size**: Sentences require much larger vocabularies
2. **Sequence Length**: Sentences are typically much longer than character sequences
3. **Semantic Complexity**: Understanding meaning vs. pattern matching
4. **Computational Resources**: More memory and processing for longer sequences
5. **Training Stability**: Longer sequences can be harder to train effectively

## Approach Options

### Option 1: Word-Level Implementation
- Tokenize sentences into words
- Build vocabulary from training data
- Modify model for word-level processing

### Option 2: Subword Implementation
- Use BPE or similar tokenization
- Handle unknown words gracefully
- Balance vocabulary size and tokenization quality

### Option 3: Character-Level Sentences
- Treat entire sentences as character sequences
- Maintain current tokenization approach
- Handle very long sequences

## Recommended Approach

For our minimal P/NP oscillator, I recommend **Option 1 (Word-Level)** with:
- Simplified sentence dataset (controlled vocabulary)
- Padding for uniform sequence lengths
- Modified model architecture for longer sequences
- Preservation of compression event detection
