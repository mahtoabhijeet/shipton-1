# P/NP Oscillating Transformer for Sentence Processing

## Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a P/NP (Predictive/Non-Predictive) Oscillating Transformer designed to process sentences and detect compression events during learning. The model is optimized to run efficiently on machines with limited resources (8GB RAM) while still providing meaningful insights into language learning patterns.

## Aims

1. **Scalable Sentence Processing**: Build a transformer model that can handle real-world text with vocabulary sizes up to 10K words and sequence lengths of 50-100 tokens.

2. **Compression Event Detection**: Implement mechanisms to detect and track compression events during training, which represent moments of insight or learning in the model.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize the model to run efficiently on consumer hardware (8GB RAM) while maintaining performance.

4. **Insight Discovery**: Use the P/NP oscillation framework to gain insights into how neural networks learn language patterns.

5. **Extensibility**: Create a foundation that can be extended to larger datasets and more complex language tasks.

## Implementation Details

### Model Architecture

The implementation features a compact transformer architecture with the following components:

- **Token Embeddings**: Word-level embeddings with positional encoding
- **Transformer Encoder**: 4 layers with 8 attention heads
- **Embedding Dimension**: 384 dimensions
- **Feedforward Dimension**: 1024 dimensions
- **Vocabulary Size**: Up to 10,000 words
- **Maximum Sequence Length**: 100 tokens

### P/NP Oscillation Framework

The model implements a P/NP (Predictive/Non-Predictive) oscillation mechanism:
- **P-mode (Phase < 0.5)**: Focus on compression and pattern consolidation
- **NP-mode (Phase â‰¥ 0.5)**: Focus on exploration and learning new patterns
- **Oscillation Function**: Sinusoidal phase oscillation with configurable period

### Compression Event Detection

Compression events are detected through rank estimation of hidden representations:
- **Rank Estimation**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based rank calculation
- **Event Detection**: Significant rank drops during P-phase
- **Thresholding**: Configurable thresholds for sensitivity

### Memory Optimization Techniques

To run efficiently on 8GB RAM:
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Float16 operations where possible
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduced memory footprint during backpropagation
- **Dynamic Batching**: Adaptive batch sizes based on sequence length
- **Efficient Attention**: Memory-optimized attention computation

### Data Pipeline

The implementation includes a complete data processing pipeline:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization and cleaning
- **Vocabulary Management**: Dynamic vocabulary building
- **Sequence Generation**: Training sample creation
- **Batching**: Efficient batch creation with padding
